# Curate FAQ App - Back-End

**USER STORY:**

As an Administrator User Iâ€™d like the ability to manage questions and answers and have them displayed to end users on a FAQ page so that I can answer commonly asked questions.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

1. Admins should be able to create, update and delete questions and answers.
2. End Users should be able to view these questions and answers.
